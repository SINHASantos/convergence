# Convergence
![Tests](https://github.com/reservoirdb/convergence/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

A Rust crate for writing servers that speak PostgreSQL's wire protocol.

Additionally, the experimental `convergence-arrow` crate enables conversion from Apache Arrow dataframes into Postgres result sets, allowing you to access your Arrow-powered data services via standard Postgres drivers.

ðŸš§ This project is _extremely_ WIP at this stage.
